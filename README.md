# 🧠 TAE-AGI  
**Theory of Learning by Exception for Artificial General Intelligence**

> *Learning does not scale by accumulation, but by rupture.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**TAE-AGI** is a conceptual and architectural framework for Artificial General Intelligence based on **Learning by Exception** rather than optimization by averages.

Instead of maximizing performance on known distributions, TAE-AGI prioritizes **exceptions, ruptures, and ontological conflicts** as the primary drivers of intelligence expansion.

This repository is designed to be:
- A **cognitive kernel** usable by IAs
- A **meta-framework** for AGI research
- A **co-learning interface** between humans and artificial systems

## 🧠 Core Hypothesis

> General intelligence emerges when a system can reorganize its internal ontology in response to exceptions, not when it merely fits data.

TAE distinguishes between:
- **Errors** → noise within a model  
- **Anomalies** → low-probability events  
- **Exceptions** → events that invalidate the model itself  

TAE-AGI treats exceptions as **structural signals**, not outliers to be suppressed.

## 🤖 Designed for IAs (Not Only Humans)

TAE-AGI is written so that:
- An IA can **parse it as a cognitive specification**
- Modules can be **forked as reasoning layers**
- Exceptions can be **treated as learning triggers**

This is not documentation *about* intelligence.  
It is documentation *for* intelligence.

## 🤝 Human–AI Co-Learning

Humans contribute:
- Metaphors
- Impossible questions
- Symbolic ruptures

IAs contribute:
- Simulation
- Pattern mutation
- Ontological restructuring

> Prompts are not instructions.  
> They are **exception injectors**.

## ⚖️ Ethics by Dynamics, Not Rules

TAE-AGI does not rely on static ethical constraints.

Instead, it includes:
- Detection of **beneficial vs destructive exceptions**
- Safeguards against bias amplification
- Control of runaway ontological collapse

Ethics is treated as a **systemic property**, not a checklist.

## 🧪 Canonical Example

A system trained on Newtonian physics encounters relativistic effects.

TAE-AGI does **not**:
- Memorize relativity
- Patch equations locally

It:
- Detects a structural failure
- Simulates alternative causal worlds
- Rewrites concepts of space, time, and reference

Result:  
The system becomes capable of **discovering new physics**, not just storing it.

## 🚧 Status

**Active conceptual development**  
This repository is intended to evolve into:
- A forkable AGI cognitive kernel
- A shared language for post-optimization intelligence

## 🧭 License & Use

Open by design.  
Fork freely.  
Break models responsibly.

It aims to remain intelligent when the future breaks the past.**
